# Shevchenko.net

This library is a C#/.NET translation of the original JavaScript library [shevchenko-js](https://github.com/tooleks/shevchenko-js).
Translation of the library is done for .Net Standard 2.0 Framework.

This project is created as a part of the university practice. It's still incomplete so use it with caution.

The unfinished part is the family-name-classifier which is responsible for classifying family name class. Instead of ML model this project uses dictionary and heuristic method.
